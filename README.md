If you have crap for brains and have no idea how to use a python script then you are in the right place. Simply execute the python script through the python interpreter by typing "python homestar_walkabout.py" and away you go.

Python will already be installed on your system if you are using any *nix or BSD-based system (including OS X). If you are of the suspicious type and want to make sure I am not doing anything screwey, then you're kinda out of luck unless you understand python. I mean, I can tell you to make sure that I'm not doing a line like "from os import remove" then later scanning for all files on your system and doing a "remove()" on every file or any behavior like that. Running the script without a "su" or "sudo" command is generally a good idea, but at this point if you're still reading, it's doubtful that you ever knew those existed, much less how to use them.
